# Churn-Model-for-Pilot-Program

🔍 Problem Statement:
In today's dynamic work environment, retaining talented employees is crucial for the success of any organization. To address this challenge, I embarked on a journey to develop a predictive model that can anticipate whether a new employee is likely to leave or stay.

💻 Tech Used:
Harnessing the power of Google Cloud Platform, I utilized BigQuery to aggregate and process a substantial dataset comprising over 15,000 rows of employee data. Leveraging the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook, I seamlessly connected to the BigQuery database and employed Pycaret for AutoML model training. After thorough experimentation with various algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boost, and K Nearest Neighbors, I identified Random Forest as the optimal choice, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99%.

📊 Findings:

Satisfaction Level: The analysis revealed that an employee's satisfaction level emerged as the most significant predictor, constituting a staggering 30% of employee sentiment.

Departmental Trends: Interestingly, the technical and support departments exhibited the highest churn rates, shedding light on areas that require focused retention efforts.

Overall Churn Rate: With an overall churn rate of 7%, it became evident that retention strategies are paramount in maintaining organizational stability and growth.

🔍📈 Insightful Visualizations:

Using Looker Studio, I crafted interactive dashboards that offer invaluable insights into employee churn dynamics. From horizontal bar charts highlighting feature importance to stacked bar charts visualizing departmental churn predictions, the dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the data landscape.
